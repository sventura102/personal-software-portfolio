# Overview
This program allows for users to add books, view the list of books from a file, search for books
based off of the author, and search for books based off of the title.

The purpose for this program is to test my abilities on how well I can manage with C# after a 
week of learning. I really enjoyed created this because I was able to learn more about loops
with this program. There are similarities between Java and C#. I was able to recognize the
differences and adjusted well.
