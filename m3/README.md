# Overview
With this program, I was able to add students, add grades, calculate the average of those grades, and print them out into the console. 

This software was primarily written to test my abilities on how well I was able to create a gradebook with Java. It really tested my abilities especially with recognizing that there are different data types, scopes, and ways to access information from Arrays and Maps.

# Future Work

- Reorganize it so that everything looks a lot cleaner and add more comments so that my future self understands what I did
- Add an input so that teachers can add students and their grades manually
- Print all the information into an .csv or .xlsx sheet for readability
