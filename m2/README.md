# Overview

For this software, I used a League of Legends API to display the champion information. It would be 
easy to just display it on the site but I decided to create a drop-down that displays agents 
based on role, listing it in alphabetical order. I used Javascript, HTML, and some CSS to display them.

The purpose for this software is to get a good idea of what my experience using APIs is, I'd like to dive into it more by allowing for the champions to be listed in different ways in reverse alphabet.

# Future Work

- Array Project - I'd like to display my work with arrays
- Different displays for API - adjusting the display to look a little bit more professional with CSS
- Implementing Filter options - creating this will allow users to see Agents under their filtered role
